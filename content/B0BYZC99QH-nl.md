ℹ️:

- Recommended pressure temperature 240 °C - 270 °C, construction platform 75 °C - 90 °C; 1. to 3. turn off low cooling fan, if your 3D printer is Bambu P1P or X1, we recommend the spray temperature above 260°C.
- TINMORRY PETG-CF is a composite material consisting of PETG and 15% professionally processed, short-cut carbon fiber masterbatch (no carbon fiber powder). The new exclusive formula significantly improves print quality by reducing nozzle clogging and clumping compared to conventional PETG, and also has very good Z adhesion. Definitely wear protective gear if you cut, grind or saw anything out of CF/GF filaments, because carbon fiber fabric is produced
- Compatibility and high-speed printing: supports high-speed 3D printing and can print at a speed of 300mm/s, 3-5 times faster than other brands Petg-CF Filament. Compatible with BAMBU LAB, Creality K1C, QIDI MAX3, FLASHFORGE Adventurer 5M, Prusa MK4, VORON and AnkerMake M5C FDM 3D Printers. If your printer is of a different brand, please contact us to get the filament profile and technical support for use.
- Very easy to print with the BAMBU FDM 3D printer, almost no distortion. Lightweight and durable, suitable for applications requiring torsion, tensile and impact resistance. It is an ideal material for drone parts, racing sports models and various functional parts.
- Tips: 1. Dry before use to achieve the best print quality (65°C, 8 hours). Pressure and maintain humidity in the reservoir < 20% RH (sealed with desiccant). 2nd Do not use conventional brass nozzles. Because the filament contains real carbon fibers, you should use wear-resistant steel nozzles (≥ 0.4 mm, better 0.6 mm). 3rd To achieve stronger Z adhesion, set a higher filling density and use a closed printer; reduce the fan part to avoid overcooling.
